# store-orders-scheduler
Schedules orders to maximize number of orders complete or value

This app was created as recruitment assignment. It takes config .json files with data about orders (realization time, max time until complete) and store (workers, when store is opened and when store is closed).

Tasks can be scheduled to maximize number of orders prepared or to maximize value of orders done
